# Overview of AI Workloads and Key Use Cases

This file is based off of chapter 3 from Tom Taulli's book.

The building blocks of powering AI:

- Content Moderation
- Personalization
- Computer Vision
- NLP
- Knowledge Mining
- Document Intelligence

## AI Principals
Ethical and practical considerations for AI is based on the following principals

- Accountability
- Inclusiveness
- Reliability
- Safety
- Fairness
- Transparency
- Security
- Privacy

## How does AI act so human?

It learns from data to make predictions that enable decision making, problem solving, understand language, recognize images, and create new media for consumption.

AI is a bunch of technologies and methods that build on each other to solve problems.

A lot of people think AI uses it's knowledge to minic us and take over. It's not the use case of actual AI.

It simply mimics human intelligence to help developers/engineers with problem solving, decision making, language understanding, and pattern recognition **intelligently** used on humans guiding them.

### Machine Learning (ML)
*Machine Learning (ML)* is under AI and allows machines to learn from data patterns.

ML does this through *algorithms* to identify patterns of the data feed and make a prediction or decisions.

Use cases: Recommendation systems, Fraud detection, and predictive analytics

### Deep Learning

*Deep Learning* is a subset of ML that uses artifical neural networks inspired by the human brain.

Kind of like... our brains 

A good example I have seen on this on the phemonmena of "The Six Degrees of Seperation" being expressed by data science.
