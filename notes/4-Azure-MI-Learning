# Chapter 5 Azure Machine Learning

We will apply the concepts from last chapter using *Azure Machine Learning*, a cloud-based service that facilitates the training, deployment, and mangement of ML models.

Azure Machine Learning streamlines the entire ML workflow, from data exploration to model deployment.

Azure Machine Learning offers two primary tools tailorred to different user preferences and objectives:

Azure Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)
    AutoML **automates the process of developing ML** models, handling tasks such as algorithm selection and hyperparamater tuning.
    It is accessible through both the Azure Machine Learning Studio's **no-code interface and the Python SDK**. 
    This means the system can cater to varying levels of expertise.

Azure Machine Learning Designer
    This tool provides a drag-and-drop interface for constructing ML pipelines without the need for coding.
    Users can visually connect datasets, transformations, and algorithms to create and deploy models efficiently.

Both tools are integrated into Azure Machine Learning Studio, offering flexibility based on user preferences and project requirements.
For this chapter, we'll provide examples of using these services.

## Introduction to Azure Machine Learning

You can use Azure Machine Learning for tasks like:

- Preparing and exploring your data
- Training and evaluating ML models
- Registering and managing models once they're trained
- Deploying models so that applications or services can use them
- Ensuring the responsible AI practices are followed

Azure Machine Learning is designed to **work with various ML platforms**, whether you're using Microsoft Azure's tools or open source frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn.
MLOps tools make it easy to monitor your models and redeploy them as needed.

Here's what Azure Machine Learning offers:

- **Centeralized dataset storage for model training and evaluation**
- **On-demand compute power to run ML jobs** like training models
- AutoML to **test different algorithms and **parameters** so that **you can find the best model for your data**
- Visual tolls that help you create **pipelines** for processess like **model training or inferencing**
- Integration with popular tools like **MLflow for managing your models at scale**
- Built-in support for evaluating **responsible AI metrics**, including fairness and model explainability

When you're ready to get started, **the first step is to set up an Azure Machine Learning workpace** in your Microsoft Azure subscription.
This workspace is your main resourcem and other resources like storage accounts and VMs are created automatically as needed.

Once your workspace is ready, you can access it through Azure Machine Learning Studio, a browser-based tool that helps you manage everything from data to deployment models.
In the studio, you can:

- Import and explore your data
- Create and manage compute resources
- Run your code in notebooks
- Build jobs and pipelines using visual tools
- Train models with automated ML
- View model details like evaluation metrics and responsible AI information
- Deploy models for **real-time or batch inferencing**
- Manage models from a comprehensive catalog

In the next two sections we'll look into how to use Azure Machine Learnning's AutoML and Azure Machine Learning Designer services.

## AutoML

We'll dive into AutoML service to train and test an ML model.
This will be for a cost prediction system for health care insurance.
