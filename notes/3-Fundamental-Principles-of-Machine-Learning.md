# Fundamental Principles of Machine Learning

Foundational techniques:

- Regression analysis
- Classification
- Clustering

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning (ML) is a branch of AI (Artifical Intelligence).
Allows systems to perform tasks like **data analysis without needing explicity instructions**.
Instead, it processes large amounts of historical data, identifies patterns, and makes predictions based on those patterns.
For instance, you can use ML to classify images, numbers, or docum,ents and make predictions from them.

Let's say you work for a financial services organization looking differentiate between **fraudulent and genuine transactions**.
With ML, the **system would learn to identify patterns from known examples** and then apply that knowledge to **predict whether a new transaction is genuine**.

ML is **essential for modern businesses** because it helps **automate data collection, classification, and analysis**. This speed us decision making and drives growth.
It improces processes like customer experience and resource managemnt, enabling businesses to solve problems faster.

Although the terms *artifical intelligence* (AI) and *machine learning* (ML) are **used interchangeably**, they **aren't the same**. 
**AI is a broader** concept that includes anything from **voice assistants to self-driving cars**.
**ML, however, focuses on specific tasks**, such as predicting equipment maintenance schedules or classifying documents.

Take manufacturing, for example, ML can help with the following:

- Predictive maintenance
    Identify potential equipment failure **before they occur**, reducing down-time and repair costs

- Quality control
    Monitor production lines to detect defects and ensure consistent product quality

- Product design optimization
    Redine designs, such as improving the abrasiveness of sandpaper by analyzing small changes in size and shape

- Supply chain management
    Predict demand, identify bottlenecks, and streamline logistics to improve efficencyf
