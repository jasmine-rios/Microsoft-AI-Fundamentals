# Chapter 2 Azure AI Vision Studio

This lab in the book was supposed to guide the user to caption a file in Azure AI Vision Studio.
However, there is no capationing and the Vision Studio is not loading for me for facial detection on 30 Nov 2025.
I will still go over how to do it in Azure.

# Steps

2. Type *computer* and the service **Computer Vision** will show up.
